# fiddles

## What is this?

Just a place for me to store all my experiments

## Why is it called `fiddles`

Because I like to use jsfiddle to send these to people for easy demos

## Can I use these?

Yes. These are all Apache 2.0 licensed code snippets. Just follow the terms of the license and you're good to go.
## How do I use these?

In each folder you'll see a .ts(x) or .js(x) file, a html file, and a css file. Paste the contents of each into the appropriate place in jsfliddle, run it, and it _should_ work. Some fiddling may be required.

### Ok, but how do I _actually_ use these?

In a project? Just copy and paste, and include a copy of the license text in a comment above where you used it. Be sure to follow the license terms and state any changes you made as well.
